🎬🤖 Deep dive into the world of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL).
🧠 The post explores an approach to integrate Reinforcement Learning with graph-based machine learning for dynamic movie recommendations.

This approach combines several techniques:

Node2Vec embeddings with Neo4j's Graph Data Science library 📊
Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for value-based learning 🎯
Clever handling of high-dimensional action spaces using (graph) embeddings 🚀
Experience replay for stable learning 🔄

Key highlights:

🌐 Preservation of complex interconnected graph structures
📈 Scalable method for large and high-dimensional datasets
🔮 Adaptive learning through (simulated) user interactions

🔬 Tech stack: Neo4j, PyTorch

This work offers a somewhat more dynamic and context-aware recommendation system that could address some of the challenges of traditional collaborative filtering methods.
